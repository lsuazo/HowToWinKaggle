Things to try:
- separate prices into integer parts and fractional parts
- create time since last holiday and time to next holiday features
- Try multilevel model a-la mcelreath
- what is a good cross validation strategy here?
- probably some items exhibit seasonal variation and some don't - treat these different
- project onto item category space and do that first
- translate text to english
- feature add: how much is the typical money comming into shop
	* so can separate shops into tiers
