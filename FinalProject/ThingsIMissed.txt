* get city names and shop type from shop names
* trend features: 
	- for each (item,month) compute mean price
	- then computed rolling mean for window 12
	- then subtracted current mean from rolling mean and divided by rolling mean - this was one feature
	- then diffed that to create another feature
	- did the same for revenue for each store
	- These 4 indicators are top or close to it
	- TODO: should do the same for revenue for each item
* got category type from category names 
	- this didn't even make it to top 20 indicators, but was in top 40
* remove shops with not enough data
	- only sold first few months, or stop selling for a while
* drop more data introduced by the pivoting
	- this appears to be important
* cut some useless indicators
	- speeds it up alot, not alot of help in scores (need to retune)
* stack more months
	- not alot of help in scores - surprising, need to retune
* add rel_revenue (trend in revenue per item) and its diff version
	- both went up to top 20
* Useful: to cross validation and hyper parameter search in organized fashion - find a pipeline
	- collect errors and plot; use trends and not just values to make decision

TODO:
	- clip objective also
	- Try clipping to only shops in the test set?
	- create shop type - cat type interaction
	- add more "trend" or relative change indicators

LESSON:
	- dont build out complex shit! my CV strategy was too dofficult to troubleshoot
