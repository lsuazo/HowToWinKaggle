* if using pd.to_datetime, must pass format - otherwise it gets confused
* there appears to be missing data
	- look at most popular item accross all shops, gaps in the plot
* december sales and jan sales seem outliers (too high too low respectively)
	- at least in considering most popular item
	- should consider removing these at first
* clipping counts makes a huge difference
	- ex: Oct2015 pred wihtout clip scored 8.something, with clip [0,20] scored 1.25011
	- this tells me to cerate clipped predictors
